# Huffman-Algorithm
A python compression and decompression program based on Huffman Coding.

# Introduction
This project is to design compression and decompression programs based on Huffman Coding. The idea of Huffman Coding is to minimize the weighted expected length of the code by means of assigning shorter codes to frequently-used characters and longer codes to seldom-used code.

# Type of data
The programs can compress and decompress text file consisting of 128 ASCII characters.

# How to use
Put your text in input_file.txt and run main.py so you will get encoded.bin file 

# Check outputfile.txt 
You will find the same input.
